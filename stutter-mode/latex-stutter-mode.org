* About

This is an example on how to use the stutter-tree structure
with a minor-mode for LaTeX.

* Code
Load the functions and the stutter-tree file
#+BEGIN-SRC emacs-lisp
(load-file "~/.emacsmodes/stutter-mode/stutter-tree.el")
(load-file "~/.emacsmodes/stutter-mode/latex-stutter-expansion-functions.el")
#+END_SRC

Create a pointer to hold the stutter-tree that will be used
#+BEGIN-SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar latex-stutter-character-expansion-tree nil
  "A tree that holds the expansion structure for stutter mode")
#+END_SRC

Create and insert the stutters you would like
#+BEGIN-SRC emacs-lisp
(defun create-latex-stutters ()
  (interactive)
  (setq latex-stutter-character-expansion-tree (list (cons 1 #'test-print)))
  (setq latex-stutter-tree-pointer latex-stutter-character-expansion-tree)
  (insert-and-create-stutter ",," #'latex-stutter-expand-inline-math-mode latex-stutter-character-expansion-tree)
  (insert-and-create-stutter ",." #'latex-stutter-expand-section-sub-section latex-stutter-character-expansion-tree)
  (insert-and-create-stutter ";;" #'latex-stutter-expand-begin-align latex-stutter-character-expansion-tree)
  (add-hook 'post-command-hook 'latex-stutter-electric-expand))
#+END_SRC

Lastly define a minor-mode
#+BEGIN-SRC emacs-lisp
(define-minor-mode latex-stutter-mode
  "A minor mode to simplify writing certain environments in
LAteX"
  :lighter "LaTeX stutter"
  :require 'latex-mode
  :version "0.1"
  ;; As every insert is simply a command, binding to post-command-hook
  ;;does the trick
  (add-hook 'post-command-hook 'latex-stutter-electric-expand)
  (create-latex-stutters))
#+END_SRC

Notice the hook
#+BEGIN-SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'post-command-hook 'latex-stutter-electric-expand)
#+END_SRC
Which makes sure that - since every keypress is a command in emacs- the stutter-tree
is updated every time we press a key.

Lastly make the minor-mode available
#+BEGIN-SRC emacs-lisp
(provide 'latex-stutter-minor-mode)
#+END_SRC
